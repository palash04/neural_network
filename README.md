# neural_network:
# It is a algorithm that replicates neurons in the brain and can be trained to learn things. Basically it's a learning algorithm   
# Types:
	1. Feed Forward Neural Network : Data just flows one way through the beginning all the way through the output layer.
	2. Recurrent Neural Network : Data flows in a cyclic manner
	3. LSTM Neural Network
